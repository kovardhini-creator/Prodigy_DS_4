Sentiment Analysis on Sample Social Media Data

Task-04 | Prodigy Infotech Internship

# Objective

This project analyzes and visualizes sentiment patterns in social media-like data to understand public opinion and attitudes toward various topics or brands.



# Overview

-- Using TextBlob for sentiment analysis, this project processes 10 manually created sample tweets and classifies them as:

-- Positive

-- Negative

-- Neutral

-- It then visualizes the sentiment distribution using a pie chart for clear and immediate understanding

# Sample Data

-- No CSV or external file is needed. The tweets are embedded directly in the script for simplicity and demonstration purposes.

# Example tweets include: 

"I love the new iPhone update! It's fantastic."

"Disappointed with the product quality."

"It was okay, not great but not bad either."



📈 Output

The project generates a pie chart representing sentiment classification:

🟩 Positive

🟥 Negative

🟦 Neutral

Each slice shows the percentage of tweets falling into each sentiment category.



# Libraries Used

-- pandas – for data handling

-- matplotlib – for plotting

-- textblob – for sentiment analysis
